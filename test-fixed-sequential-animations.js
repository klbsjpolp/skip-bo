  console.log('1. Removed auto-removal timeout for draw animations in CardAnimationContext');
  console.log('2. Modified triggerMultipleDrawAnimations to manually control when cards appear');
  console.log('3. Each card now appears exactly when its animation completes');
  console.log('4. No more stacking delays between animations');

  console.log('- Card 1 animates from deck to hand position');
  console.log('- Card 1 appears in hand immediately when animation completes');
  console.log('- Brief pause (stagger delay)');
  console.log('- Card 2 starts animating');
  console.log('- Card 2 appears in hand immediately when animation completes');
  console.log('- And so on...');
  
  console.log('\n‚ùå PREVIOUS ISSUES (now fixed):');
  console.log('- Cards appearing all at once after all animations completed');
  console.log('- Long delays between animation end and card appearance');
  console.log('- Stacking delays that got worse with more cards');
  
  console.log('\nüìã MANUAL TEST INSTRUCTIONS:');
  console.log('1. Start a new game');
  console.log('2. Watch the initial card dealing - should be smooth and sequential');
  console.log('3. Play cards until your hand is empty to trigger hand refill');
  console.log('4. Observe that refill cards appear one by one without delays');
  console.log('5. Let the AI play until it empties its hand');
  console.log('6. Verify AI animations are also sequential without delays');

  console.log('- Smooth, rhythmic card dealing pattern');
