# Animation Fixes Summary

## Issue Description
The original issue described several problems with card drawing animations:
1. AI cards were visible when moving from deck to hand (should remain face-down)
2. Wrong timing between move animation and card appearing in hand
3. Large delays before cards appear, getting worse with more cards
4. Cards should move one at a time and stay in position as more are drawn

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Hide AI Cards During Animation
**File:** `src/components/AnimatedCard.tsx`
**Change:** Added `shouldRevealCard()` logic to check animation type and player index
- AI cards (playerIndex 1) now remain face-down during draw animations
- Human cards (playerIndex 0) are still revealed during draw animations
- Play and discard animations continue to reveal all cards as expected

### 2. Fix Timing Between Animation and Card Appearance
**Files:** 
- `src/services/drawAnimationService.ts`
- `src/hooks/useSkipBoGame.ts`

**Changes:**
- Removed waiting for all animations to complete before updating game state
- Game state now updates with only 50ms delay instead of full animation wait
- Implemented individual card completion callbacks
- Cards appear in hand immediately when their animation completes

### 3. Implement Sequential Card Movement
**File:** `src/services/drawAnimationService.ts`
**Change:** Replaced staggered parallel animations with truly sequential animations
- Each card now waits for the previous one to complete before starting
- Cards move one at a time from deck to hand position
- Cards stay in position as more are drawn
- Small delay between cards for visual clarity

### 4. Eliminate Cumulative Delays
**Result of above changes:**
- No more waiting for all cards before any appear in hand
- Each card appears immediately when its animation completes
- Predictable timing regardless of number of cards drawn
- Smooth, sequential card drawing experience

## Technical Changes Made

1. **AnimatedCard.tsx:** Added conditional card revelation logic
2. **drawAnimationService.ts:** 
   - Implemented sequential animation loop
   - Added onCardComplete callback system
   - Changed from parallel to sequential processing
3. **useSkipBoGame.ts:** 
   - Removed waiting for all animations to complete
   - Added individual card completion handling
   - Reduced delay from full animation duration to 50ms

## Testing Results

- **Component Tests:** ✅ All 35 tests passed
- **Game Reducer Tests:** ✅ All 25 tests passed  
- **Game Machine Tests:** 4 tests failing (pre-existing issues unrelated to animation changes)
- **Animation-specific verification:** ✅ All issues addressed

## Expected Behavior Now

✅ AI cards remain face-down during draw animations
✅ Cards move one at a time from deck to hand position
✅ Each card appears in hand immediately when animation completes
✅ No cumulative delays - consistent timing regardless of card count
✅ Smooth, sequential card drawing experience

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/AnimatedCard.tsx` - Card revelation logic
2. `src/services/drawAnimationService.ts` - Sequential animation system
3. `src/hooks/useSkipBoGame.ts` - Animation timing improvements

All changes are minimal and focused specifically on the animation issues described in the original problem statement.
