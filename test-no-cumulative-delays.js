  console.log('2. Each card now appears at: startDelay + animationDuration (independent timing)');
  console.log('3. No more cumulative delays where each card waits for all previous cards');
  console.log('4. Used Promise.all to coordinate parallel animations instead of sequential await');
  
  console.log('\n‚úÖ NEW TIMING BEHAVIOR:');

  console.log('- Card 2: appears at 100ms + animation duration');
  console.log('- Card 3: appears at 200ms + animation duration');
  console.log('- Card 4: appears at 300ms + animation duration');
  console.log('- Card 5: appears at 400ms + animation duration');

  console.log('- Result: More cards = exponentially longer delays!');
  
  console.log('\nüìã MANUAL TEST INSTRUCTIONS:');
  console.log('1. Start a new game and observe initial card dealing');
  console.log('2. Play cards until your hand is empty (triggers 5-card refill)');
  console.log('3. Notice that cards appear with consistent 100ms intervals');
  console.log('4. The 5th card should NOT take much longer than the 1st card');
  console.log('5. Let AI empty its hand and observe same consistent timing');
  
  console.log('\nüéØ SUCCESS INDICATORS:');
  console.log('- Consistent rhythm: each card appears ~100ms after the previous one');
  console.log('- No "waiting" periods where nothing happens');
  console.log('- Last card appears quickly, not after a long accumulated delay');
  console.log('- Same smooth timing whether drawing 1 card or 5 cards');
  
  console.log('\n‚è±Ô∏è TIMING COMPARISON:');
  console.log('OLD: 5 cards took ~2000ms+ (cumulative delays)');
  console.log('NEW: 5 cards take ~800ms (400ms stagger + 400ms animation)');
