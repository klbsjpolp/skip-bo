# Card Visibility Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When cards are drawn from the deck, the animation to move them from the deck to the correct position in the human or AI hand works correctly. However, the cards are visible during the entire animation instead of appearing only at the end of each individual movement. This creates a visual inconsistency where cards can be seen moving from the deck to the hand, rather than appearing in the hand after the animation completes.

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the code and adding debug logs, we identified the following issue:

In `AnimatedCard.tsx`, cards were always revealed during animations due to the hardcoded `isRevealed={true}` property:

```jsx
<Card
  card={animation.card}
  isRevealed={true}  // Cards always visible during animation
  canBeGrabbed={false}
  className="shadow-lg"
/>
```

This meant that all cards, including those in draw animations, were visible throughout the entire animation process, rather than appearing only at the end of their individual movements.

## Fix Implementation
We modified the `AnimatedCard.tsx` component to:

1. **Add state to control card visibility** during animations:
   ```jsx
   const [isRevealed, setIsRevealed] = useState(false);
   ```

2. **Set initial visibility based on animation type**:
   ```jsx
   // For draw animations, only reveal the card at the end of the animation
   // This ensures cards appear only when they reach their destination
   const isDraw = animation.animationType === 'draw';
   
   // Set initial reveal state based on animation type
   // For draw animations, start hidden; for other types, start revealed
   setIsRevealed(!isDraw);
   ```

3. **Reveal draw animation cards at the end of the animation**:
   ```jsx
   // If it's a draw animation, reveal the card at the end of the animation
   let revealTimer: number | undefined;
   if (isDraw) {
     revealTimer = window.setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(`üé¥ Card ${animation.card.value} now REVEALED at end of animation`);
       setIsRevealed(true);
     }, animation.duration - 50); // Reveal slightly before animation ends for smooth transition
   }
   ```

4. **Update the Card component to use the dynamic reveal state**:
   ```jsx
   <Card
     card={animation.card}
     isRevealed={isRevealed}  // Now dynamically controlled
     canBeGrabbed={false}
     className="shadow-lg"
   />
   ```

5. **Add CSS classes to reflect the card's visibility state**:
   ```jsx
   className={cn(
     'animated-card',
     `animation-${animation.animationType}`,
     isRevealed ? 'card-revealed' : 'card-hidden'
   )}
   ```

## Additional Logging
We added comprehensive console logs throughout the animation process to help debug and verify the fix:

1. In `AnimatedCard.tsx`:
   ```javascript
   console.log(`üé¥ Card ${animation.card.value} now REVEALED at end of animation`);
   ```

2. In `drawAnimationService.ts`:
   ```javascript
   console.log(`üîç Card ${i+1}/${cards.length} should be HIDDEN during animation and appear at the end`);
   console.log(`üîÑ Removing animation ${animationId} for Card: ${cards[i].value}`);
   ```

## Verification
We created a verification script (`test-card-visibility-fix.js`) that:

1. Tracks animation events with timestamps
2. Monitors console logs for animation-related messages
3. Analyzes the timing of events for each card
4. Checks if the sequence of events is correct (start ‚Üí hidden ‚Üí revealed ‚Üí finish)
5. Provides an overall assessment of whether the fix is working correctly

## Expected Results
With this fix:

1. Cards are now hidden during draw animations
2. Cards only appear when they reach their destination (at the end of each individual movement)
3. The animation sequence is more natural and visually consistent
4. Each card appears independently when its individual animation completes

This creates a better user experience where cards appear to be drawn from the deck and revealed only when they reach the player's hand, rather than being visible throughout the entire animation.

## Testing
To test this fix:
1. Run the game in a browser
2. Start a new game (should trigger initial card dealing)
3. Play cards until your hand is empty (should trigger hand refill)
4. Watch for when cards visually appear on screen
5. Verify that cards are hidden during animation and only appear at the end
6. For more detailed analysis, run the verification script in the browser console
